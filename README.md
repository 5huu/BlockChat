# BlockChat - Decentralized Messaging DApp

BlockChat is a decentralized messaging DApp (decentralized application) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to securely exchange messages and files without relying on centralized intermediaries, ensuring privacy, security, and censorship resistance.

## Features

- **Secure Messaging:** Messages are encrypted and stored on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof communication.
- **File Sharing:** Users can securely share files using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), with files stored off-chain for efficiency.
- **Smart Contract Integration:** BlockChat leverages Ethereum smart contracts for trustless interactions and transparent record-keeping.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive UI/UX design for seamless navigation and user experience.
- **Recipient Address Management:** Users can store and manage recipient addresses for easy access to contacts.

## Tools Used

- **Ethereum Blockchain:** Foundation for decentralized messaging and smart contract execution.
- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** Decentralized file storage protocol for efficient and secure file sharing.
- **Web3.js:** JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
- **MetaMask:** Ethereum wallet and gateway to blockchain applications.
- **Solidity:** Smart contract programming language for Ethereum.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Frontend development stack for building the user interface and client-side logic.

## Usage

BlockChat offers a user-friendly and intuitive platform for secure messaging and file sharing, powered by blockchain technology. Users can easily navigate through the application to communicate with friends, colleagues, and other contacts in a decentralized and privacy-enhanced manner. Below is a guide on how to use BlockChat effectively:

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have MetaMask installed and set up with an Ethereum account.
- Install XAMPP or another local server environment to host the BlockChat application locally.

### Creating an Account:
- To use BlockChat, users need to have an Ethereum account.
- Users can create or import an Ethereum account using MetaMask, a popular Ethereum wallet and browser extension.

### Connecting MetaMask:
- Before accessing BlockChat, users need to connect their MetaMask wallet to the application.
- MetaMask provides secure authentication and transaction signing for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

### Storing Recipient Addresses:
- Users can store recipient addresses within BlockChat for easy access when sending messages and files.
- Simply enter the recipient's Ethereum address and click the "Store Recipient Address" button.

### Sending Messages:
- To send a message, select the recipient's address from the dropdown menu.
- Type the message content in the input field and click the "Send" button.
- The message is transmitted securely to the recipient via the Ethereum blockchain.

### Sending Files:

- Click the file input button to select the file from your device.
- Once selected, click the "Send" button to initiate the file transfer.
- Files are uploaded to the IPFS network for decentralized storage, and the IPFS hash is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Viewing Messages and Files:
- Users can view their messages and files within the chat interface.
- Messages are displayed in chronological order, along with timestamps indicating when they were sent.
- Files are presented as clickable links, allowing users to download and view them directly from the IPFS network.
